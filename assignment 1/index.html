  <h4>STRICT VETTING</h4>
<p>Our goal is not to run hobby classes but instead to create job ready candidates. So we are selective in who we train. We conduct a mathematical aptitude test to filter out students who have the raw talent needed for a successful software engineering career. Then we take personal interview to check if they have strong will needed to achieve their dreams.</p>

  <h4>RIGOROUS TRAINING</h4>
  <p>Selected students are trained rigorously for 6 months under the guidance of experienced mentors and teaching assistants. Itâ€™s not passive teaching; instead students build a number of apps as part of the curriculum. We keep our curriculum in constant sync with industry needs so that students are not taught anything obsolete in this fast moving tech world.

  <h4>SOFT SKILLS COACHING</h4>
  <p>We understand how important 'people skills' are for a successful career. That's why soft skills coaching is an integral part of our curriculum. We have a continuous feedback process in place to help you improve and grow.</p>

  <h4>PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE</h4>

  <h3>OUR MOTIVATION ?</h3>
   <p>This Quote from Talmud is our guiding force:</p>
     
    <p> Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly now, love mercy now, walk humbly now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.</p>
     
    <p> So we are just honestly trying to do our bit to help achieve equality of opportunity.</p>
